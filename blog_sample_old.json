"full_content": "Firstly, my spending habits were dominant. Money became a double-edged sword for my mental health, that I am going to put it to the side. Society and media filled my head with so many choices that it made me feel wealthier than I actually am. To me, pointing this out feels liberating, as it shows the potential I have to control my finances. \n\n Secondly, I overrelied on others. I became too dependent on people's positive feedback. I have a hard time making my own decisions sometimes when put under a lot of pressure.\n\nA part of growing up in my opinion is learning how not to let things get to you. It may be difficult at the beginning, but it's a skill just like anything else.\n\nTaking ownership also means taking responsibility. For me, independence is something to embrace. That's not to say that things will be okay as a one man army, but it'll strengthen my confidence in the long run.\n\nThis post may not be as light-hearted as most of my other ones, but that's okay. The big picture to look at here is that if you're content, do what you can to improve.",

My nerves were kicking in, but managed to keep my cool on the first day back. Meeting people from different kinds of backgrounds and skill levels, it was refreshing to see everyone thrive in a fully positive and inclusive environment.\n\nThe bootcamp taught me that social connections are most certainly possible, with the right group, place, and time. That's not to say that a bootcamp is always going to be a life-changing experience, but it can help guide you in the right direction.",
