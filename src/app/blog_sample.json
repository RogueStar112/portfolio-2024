To me, pointing this out feels liberating, as it shows the potential I have to control my finances. \n\n Secondly, I overrelied on others. I became too dependent on people's positive feedback. I have a hard time making my own decisions sometimes when put under a lot of pressure.\n\nA part of growing up in my opinion is learning how not to let things get to you. It may be difficult at the beginning, but it's a skill just like anything else.\n\nTaking ownership also means taking responsibility. For me, independence is something to embrace. That's not to say that things will be okay as a one man army, but it'll strengthen my confidence in the long run.\n\nThis post may not be as light-hearted as most of my other ones, but that's okay.

My nerves were kicking in, but managed to keep my cool on the first day back. Meeting people from different kinds of backgrounds and skill levels, it was refreshing to see everyone thrive in a fully positive and inclusive environment.\n\n To this day, this coding bootcamp has shaped the way I've looked at education in general. That there IS hope out there, and if you work hard and stay calm under pressure, you can achieve the best of work.\n\nThe bootcamp taught me that social connections are most certainly possible, with the right group, place, and time. That's not to say that a bootcamp is always going to be a life-changing experience, but it can help guide you in the right direction.\n\n(UPDATE: July 2024)\nEver since I graduated 7 months ago, I've had an itching curiosity that just won't stop growing. I feel like it's thanks to this bootcamp that I've not given up my passion for coding entirely.",

Give them a go!</t>\nDefinitely haven't written this at 2:30am without some compelling reason!\n\n From my experience, autism isn't something I would take away but rather acknowledge that it's going to be a lifelong condition. And that's okay! While I see myself as needing extra accomodations at times to help me regulate my tasks and mood, this shouldn't stop me from reaching my full potential.\n\nI have special interests, but I don't really have the ability to 'infodump' about them because of how hard they are to explain to people.\n\nAutism has made me accept imperfections in my life, that I especially can't control. For instance, I can't control inflation. I focus on what I can control instead.\n\nFor example, it's much easier to control my mood. Whether it'd be from taking deep breaths, to taking things more slowly than usual.\n\nI feel like being understood for who I am comes with the neurodiverse package as well, but also being mindful that it won't necessarily restrict my decision-making. I don't expect the world to accomodate for me.\n\nIn my opinion, I find the word 'neurotypical' rather hostile. It's sort of like treating them as if they have no way of thinking outside the 'norm'. It's also the same for neurodivergence. While I can't necessarily come up with a more 'appealing' name for both terms, I do think that one phrase stands out the most- 'Human.' we are going to experience emotionally driven decisions either way.\n\nThis is not a call for people to pick on others because of their brain structures.\n\nAs an autistic person, I don't directly advocate for more acceptance. I advocate for people however, to be more mindful. To tap into our innate empathy. If you were in someone else's shoes, who was overwhelmed by loud noises and bright lights, would you tell them to just 'snap out of it'?\n\nAlso, I want to clarify that my personal experiences of autism are unique, but does NOT translate to quirkiness. You can view autism or neurodivergence however you wish, but what it shouldn't be regarded as, in my honest opinion, is to use it as an excuse for bad behaviour.\n\nFor me, It took way too long to realize that the only person who can turn their own life around is themselves. If I don't look after myself, I will become more pessimistic, and in turn, poor mental health arises.",
