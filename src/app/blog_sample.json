Society and media filled my head with so many choices that it made me feel wealthier than I actually am. To me, pointing this out feels liberating, as it shows the potential I have to control my finances. \n\n Secondly, I overrelied on others. I became too dependent on people's positive feedback. I have a hard time making my own decisions sometimes when put under a lot of pressure.\n\nA part of growing up in my opinion is learning how not to let things get to you. It may be difficult at the beginning, but it's a skill just like anything else.\n\nTaking ownership also means taking responsibility. For me, independence is something to embrace. That's not to say that things will be okay as a one man army, but it'll strengthen my confidence in the long run.\n\nThis post may not be as light-hearted as most of my other ones, but that's okay. The big picture to look at here is that if you're content, do what you can to improve.",

My nerves were kicking in, but managed to keep my cool on the first day back. Meeting people from different kinds of backgrounds and skill levels, it was refreshing to see everyone thrive in a fully positive and inclusive environment.\n\n To this day, this coding bootcamp has shaped the way I've looked at education in general. That there IS hope out there, and if you work hard and stay calm under pressure, you can achieve the best of work.\n\nThe bootcamp taught me that social connections are most certainly possible, with the right group, place, and time. That's not to say that a bootcamp is always going to be a life-changing experience, but it can help guide you in the right direction.",

And that's okay! While I see myself as needing extra accomodations at times to help me regulate my tasks and mood, this shouldn't stop me from reaching my full potential.\n\nAutism has made me accept imperfections in my life, that I especially can't control. For instance, I can't control inflation. I focus on what I can control instead.\n\nFor example, it's much easier to control my mood. Whether it'd be from taking deep breaths, to taking things more slowly than usual.\n\nI feel like being understood for who I am comes with the neurodiverse package as well, but also being mindful that it won't necessarily restrict my decision-making. I don't expect the world to accomodate for me.\n\nIn my opinion, I find the word 'neurotypical' rather hostile. It's sort of like treating them as if they have no way of thinking outside the 'norm'. It's also the same for neurodivergence. While I can't necessarily come up with a more 'appealing' name for both terms, I do think that one phrase stands out the most- 'Human.' we are going to experience emotionally driven decisions either way.\n\nThis is not a call for people to pick on others because of their brain structures.\n\nAs an autistic person, I don't directly advocate for more acceptance. I advocate for people however, to be more mindful. To tap into our innate empathy. If you were in someone else's shoes, who was overwhelmed by loud noises and bright lights, would you tell them to just 'snap out of it'?",

A lot of the things I've learnt over the years, can now be summarized by a chatbot who can shove its encyclopedia of answers right in front of our fingertips.\n\nAs much as I'd love to embrace AI, there's a lot of questions left in my mind that I've barely even asked throughout my life, because I was too busy pursuing those dreams.\n\nEmbracing myself was when I knew when to stop pursuing that train. That really the worst enemy was myself, my ego, and how these two affect others around me.\n\nMy biggest fear is coming across as someone who always looks out for themself, and never anybody else. That is one of the main reasons why I get out of bed everyday. While comfort is really important, embracing the unknown and taking risks is vital to spicing up life.\n\nBattling my worst perception of myself is difficult.

But not all things that are scary are necessarily bad.\n\nWhen someone asked me how I felt taking the bus in this village for the first time\n I replied: 'Regardless of how I feel right now, I have to take the bus there. No amount of anxiety can change that.'\n\nI thought, that getting home was more important than whatever anxiety I had, which I think shows a lot of personal growth.\n\nWhile my walks at the local park are still there, I still don't feel like I'm fully engaging with life.
